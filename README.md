# Movie App

This is a simple React-based movie application that displays movies and their trailers.

## Task Objectives
- Implement a React app that fetches and displays movie data.
- Allow users to view trailers for selected movies.
- Ensure the code is clean, well-structured, and well-commented.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Axios (for fetching movie data)
- React-YouTube (for embedding trailers)
- Movie API (e.g., TMDb API)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works
- The app fetches movie data from an API and displays it in a list format.
- Clicking on a movie fetches and plays its trailer using `react-youtube`.
- API calls are handled with `axios`.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.
4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Notes
- The trailer feature uses the `react-youtube` package to embed YouTube trailers.
- Ensure your API key is correctly configured in the project.
- If you want to see the website directly click the deployment in the right side of the repository page it will give you the live link.

## Code Quality
- The code is clean, structured, and well-commented.
- Followed best practices for React development.
